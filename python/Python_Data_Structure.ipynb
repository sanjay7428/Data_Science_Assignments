    "Ans: \n",
    "1. Mutability\n",
    "The main difference between lists and tuples is that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list can be changed after it's created. You can add, remove, or modify items in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple cannot be changed once it's created. Any attempt to modify it will raise an error.\n",
    "2. Performance\n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, they are generally faster and use less memory than lists. So if you don’t need to change the data, using a tuple can make your code run a little faster.\n",

    " 3. Use Cases\n",

    "\n",
    "You need to change the data later (e.g., adding/removing items).\n",

    "Use a tuple when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to make sure the data stays constant (e.g., coordinates, dates).\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to use the collection as a key in a dictionary (because tuples are hashable and lists are not).\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Methods and Functionality\n",
    "Lists support many built-in methods such as append(), remove(), reverse(), etc., because they’re designed to be flexible.\n",

    "Tuples, being fixed, support only a few methods like count() and index().\n",

    "Lists are mutable: You can modify any item in a list.\n",

    "3. Methods\n",

    "Strings Immutable in Python?\n",
    "In Python, strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed — you can't modify, delete, or replace characters in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons Why Strings Are Immutable:\n",
    "1. Efficiency and Performance\n",
    "Immutable objects like strings are stored in memory efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they can’t change, Python reuses existing string objects, reducing memory usage.\n",

    "This helps with faster execution, especially when working with many strings.\n",

    "2. Safety and Predictability\n",

    "3. Hashability\n",
    "Strings are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets.\n",

    "In a list, searching for an item means going through elements one by one (linear search).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dictionary, you can instantly access a value using its key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Key-Value Pairing\n",
    "Dictionaries are ideal when each value needs to be labeled or identified uniquely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lists (which use numeric indexes), dictionaries use meaningful keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No Need to Remember Index Positions\n",
    "With lists, you must remember or look up the index to get specific data.\n",

    "With dictionaries, you just use the key — much more readable and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Flexible and Dynamic\n",

    "Why Are Dictionaries Considered Unordered?\n",
    "Historically, Python dictionaries were unordered, meaning the items inside a dictionary didn’t have a guaranteed order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, optimized for fast lookup by key rather than maintaining any order.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " What About Modern Python?\n",
    "Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve insertion order as an official language feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, when you iterate over a dictionary or convert it to a list, the items come out in the order you added them.\n",
    "\n",
    " How Does Being Unordered Affect Data Retrieval?\n",
    "When dictionaries were unordered, you could not rely on the order of items for iteration or display.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this doesn’t affect key-based lookup speed — retrieving a value by key is still very fast (average O(1) time).\n",
    "\n",
    "For operations that depend on order (like sorting or ordered iteration), you had to use other data structures such as collections.OrderedDict (before Python 3.7) or now rely on the built-in order preservation.\n",
