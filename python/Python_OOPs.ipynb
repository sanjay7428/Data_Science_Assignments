    "Polymorphism Works in Python with Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many forms\" — it allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through inheritance by overriding methods in child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    " Key Idea:\n",
    "If a base class defines a method, and subclasses override it with their own implementation, Python can call the correct method based on the object's actual class, not the reference type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Extensibility: You can add new subclasses without changing existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code simplicity: You don’t need complex if-else or type() checks.\n",
